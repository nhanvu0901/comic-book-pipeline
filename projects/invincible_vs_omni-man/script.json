  "summary": "Following the massacre of the Guardians of the Globe, Omni-Man finally reveals his true Viltrumite heritage to his son Mark. What begins as an uncomfortable conversation explodes into the most brutal father-son battle in comic book history. Across three issues, Nolan beats Mark mercilessly through city streets, subway tunnels, and past innocent civilians — including the infamous train scene where their bodies split a train car in half. The fight is one-sided devastation, with every punch carrying the weight of imperial duty against fatherly hesitation. In the end, Nolan leaves his son broken but alive — unable to kill the only thing he truly loved on Earth. Mark is left floating in the vacuum of space, watching his father abandon everything.",
